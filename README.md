# CTF-Writeup
Collection of my CTF writeups. You can find the most updated ones on [my website](https://isopach.dev), and this repo is being kept for archival purposes only, as I still have my writeups from 2018 here linked to ctftime writeups.

Some links may be broken as I might have written it on my site and not here - but I will update them soon^tm.

Sometimes CTFs overlap so I may start 1-2 days late during a longer CTF. Also, sometimes I'm busy so I end up not writing any writeups.
