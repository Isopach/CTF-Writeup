# Mouse

We're given a binary file `mouse`.

I tried opening it with IDA and discovered strings like `Intel`, `Wireshark` and `Windows`, so I decided to open it in Wireshark instead.

We soon find out that it is a USB pcap file, with inputs `b` and `c` only.

However, the hex shown vary with many various digits, so we thought of using a USB translator, which you can also find at Microsoft's official page: 

[USB HID to PS/2 Scan Code Translation Table - Microsoft](https://download.microsoft.com/download/1/6/1/161ba512-40e2-4cc9-843a-923143f3456c/translate.pdf)

Hence we wrote a python script to translate the hex into their alphanumeric counterparts:

which gives us a string with all the direction characters (Left, Right and Enter) at the bottom.

So, starting at the end of the string, we follow the directions and press the keyboard accordingly to get:

```

```

The flag is in the first column of the code: `ISITDTU{I_L0V3_K3yB0ARD}`
