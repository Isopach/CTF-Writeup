# Do Stars Spin? 2

[On page that gave the flag](https://web.archive.org/web/20200527041338/https://www.reddit.com/user/dostarsevenspin/) in the last challenge, the most recent post was a hint pointing to [dostarsevenspin's instagram](http://instagram.com/dostarsevenspin).

```
Hey, I need help on my instagram profile
How do I delete posts? Here is my handle: @ dostarsevenspin
```

As there is no way to recover a deleted instagram or twitter post of another user, unless you have cached it beforehand, I knew it was a red herring, especially since the profile listed links to his Twitter and Snapchat as well.

```
Stars Spin?
Twitter: starsdonotspin
Reddit: dostarsevenspin
Sc: starsspinn't
Follow me for free flag (dm too)
^imagine falling for that
flag{no}
```

As we all know, Snapchat deletes posts after 24 hours so I didn't even bother looking there.

So I went to the Twitter page and noticed [a tweet](https://twitter.com/starsdonotspin/status/1266119748737290242) where he linked to 2 wikipedia pages

Go to Wikipedia page > View History > and you'll notice his contribution and revert on [Spin Stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Spin_Star&action=history)

Sadly neither the `Spin Stars` nor `Stars` page gave any details.

However, when you go to his profile and [list his contributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Dostarsspin), there is an edit on the Wikipedia entry for [Flag](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Flag&oldid=959455544) which gave the flag.

Here is the exact section for your viewing pleasure:
